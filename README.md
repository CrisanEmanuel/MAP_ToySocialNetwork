# MAP_ToySocialNetwork
### A custom "toy" social network app built on Java
This project is a toy social network app developed in Java with JavaFX for the GUI. It was created as part of an advanced programming course where I applied various programming methods learned throughout the semester.

## Features

- User authentication and registration
- Adding, rejecting friend requests
- Messaging between users
- The admin page provides administrators with comprehensive control and management capabilities within the application.

## Technical Details

- Implemented using JavaFX for the GUI.
- Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Utilizes advanced programming methods learned during the semester, including domain-driven design, lambdas, JavaFX UI development, database connectivity, file handling in Java, and the observer pattern.
